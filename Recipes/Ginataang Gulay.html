    <h2><br>Description</h2>
    <p>“Ginataang Gulay is a traditional Filipino dish,” Letrero says. “In Tagalog, ‘gulay’ means ‘vegetable,’ and ‘ginataang’ means ‘done or cooked with coconut milk.’ At the restaurant, we like to keep most of our dishes fairly traditional but also add our own special twist. While most ginataang gulay recipes call to cook the vegetables all at once, our version at Bayan Ko cooks the vegetables in separate batches to keep their integrity.” </p>

    <h2><br>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces haricots verts, halved crosswise (about 1 1/4 cups)</li>
        <li>2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>3 medium japanese eggplant, cut into 1/2-inch-thick half-moons (3 cups)</li>
        <li>1 pound sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 3 cups)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>10 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced (about 2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 (13.6-ounce) cans unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 (5-ounce) package baby spinach</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus cilantro leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh mint, plus mint leaves for garnish</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 limes)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sambal oelek or chile paste</li>
        <li>Cooked jasmine rice and lime wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><br>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. In separate batches, cook the vegetables (in this order: haricots verts, zucchini, eggplant, and sweet potato) until each vegetable is almost al dente, 1 minute and 30 seconds for haricots verts, 2 to 3 minutes for zucchini and eggplant, and 6 to 8 minutes for sweet potatoes. Drain vegetables, and transfer to a baking sheet; set aside.</li> 
        <br><li><strong>Step: </strong>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add onion, garlic, ginger, salt, and black pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <br><li><strong>Step: </strong>Stir in coconut milk, scraping bottom of Dutch oven to remove any browned bits. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Fold in spinach until it begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Stir in reserved vegetables. Bring to a simmer over medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro, mint, scallions, lime juice, and sambal oelek. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with cilantro and mint leaves; serve with rice and lime wedges. </li>
    </ol>
